# Bisq API Python Examples

This subproject contains Python3 classes demonstrating API gRPC method calls, and some sample bots.

Each class in
the [bisq.rpccalls](https://github.com/ghubstan/bisq-api-reference/tree/main/python-examples/bisq/rpccalls) package is
named for the RPC method call being demonstrated.

The `run-setup.sh` script in this directory can install Python3 dependencies and example packages into a local venv.
