# Bisq API Java Examples

This subproject contains Java classes demonstrating API gRPC method calls.

Each class in
the [bisq.rpccalls](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference/tree/main/java-examples/src/main/java/bisq/rpccalls)
package is named for the RPC method call being demonstrated.

The subproject uses a
a [Gradle build file](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference/blob/main/java-examples/build.gradle), also
demonstrating how to generate the necessary protobuf classes from the Bisq .proto files.
